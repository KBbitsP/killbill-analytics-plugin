These are all views to support the Payment Provider Monitor report which shows the number
of successful transactions that have occurred in the past hour, for each payment service
provider that has had transactions within the last week.

The report is expected to access:
v_report_payment_provider_monitor

The other views are to support this view as MySQL does not allow subqueries within views.
