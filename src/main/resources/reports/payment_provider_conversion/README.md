These are all views to support the Payment Provider Conversion report which shows the numbers
of successful transactions and total transactions that have occurred in a recent 15 minute 
period and the numbers of successful transactions and total transactions that occurred in
the corresponding 15 minutes from 14 days ago.

The report is expected to access:
v_report_payment_provider_conversion

The other view is to support this view as MySQL does not allow subqueries within views.
